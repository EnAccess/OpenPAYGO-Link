# OpenPAYGO Link
Open PAYGO Link (OPLink) is a communication protocol created as an open source standard solution for interfacing Solar Home Systems (SHS) with appliances and accessories. It is defined at hardware and software levels and features a half-duplex communication over a single wire with a multi-drop connection topology. It ensures reliable data transmission, even with different ground potentials between nodes, thanks to an off the shelf transceiver. Although it is not intended to transmit long frames it supports any variable-length payload. Check the compatible targets below.

## What is implemented
* The network uses a master/slave configuration.
* Two kinds of messages are available: request/reply and broadcast.
* The master can automatically discover new slaves and assign them a local address.
* Slave nodes can instantly detect that they have been disconnected, the master requires polling.
* The library API provides a unique ID list of the connected nodes. The mapping from UID to local address is done internally.
* A node can only handle one request at a time.
* Slave nodes can directly send messages to the master (no need for polling from the master).

## Compatible MCUs
In order to implement the OpenPAYGO Link in a specific MCU it needs to support 9-bit multiprocessor UART with address mode wake up. Some compatible MCUs are listed below:

* STM8
Supports 8-9 bit address mode with 4 bit addresses
